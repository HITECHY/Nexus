# NEXUS - Streamlined Backend with Secure Payments

NEXUS is an ordering website developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), designed to streamline the ordering process with a robust backend and secure payment integration. Currently in the testing phase, the site is optimized for scalability and efficiency, preparing for live transactions.

## Features
- **Full-Stack Development**: Built using JavaScript, React for the frontend, and Node.js with Express for the backend.
- **Database**: MongoDB for secure and efficient data storage.
- **Payment Integration**: Secure payment processing with Stripe.
- **Scalability**: Optimized to handle a growing number of users and orders.
- **Frontend Optimization**: Focused on responsive design and user experience.
- **Backend Efficiency**: Structured for high performance and quick response times.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB (Mongoose)
- **Payment Gateway**: Stripe
- **API Testing**: Postman (for backend routes)
- **Deployment**: [Deployment platform used, e.g., AWS/Heroku]

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/nexus.git
    cd nexus
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your environment variables (e.g., MongoDB URI, Stripe API key):
    ```bash
    MONGO_URI=your-mongodb-uri
    STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your-stripe-secret-key
    ```

4. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

5. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the app in action.

## Usage

1. Users can browse through available products, add them to their cart, and proceed to checkout.
2. Secure payment is handled through Stripe, ensuring transaction safety.
3. Orders and user data are stored in MongoDB, with the ability to manage, update, and track orders.

## Testing

- Ensure your MongoDB and Stripe configurations are correct.
- Test the API endpoints using Postman or any API client.
- Verify that payment processing works securely by simulating transactions.
